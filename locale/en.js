The maximum amount that can be raised also depends on the type of project and the country where it is located. Usually, Nacometa sets a limit on fundraising in the amount of 1 million US dollars, and the maximum fundraising period is 90 days. However, it is possible to extend the fundraising period if necessary, after coordination with the platform team.',

                answer: 'Yes, fundraising through the Nacometa platform is legal. However, it depends on the goals of the person raising funds. If the fundraising is aimed at creating a project or business, then tax obligations must be taken into account. In most countries, there are tax rules that regulate the payment of taxes on profits earned. Therefore, if you are raising funds to create a business or project, you need to find out what tax obligations exist in your country and what needs to be done. In any case, it is recommended to consult a lawyer or tax consultant to obtain specific information about tax obligations and special requirements in your country.',
